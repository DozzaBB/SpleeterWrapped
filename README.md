# SpleeterWrapped
wrapped nicer version of spleeter with youtube-dl included for speedy filing.


acquire via: 

* conda create -n py37 python=3.7
* clone this repo into your conda env
* conda install -c conda-forge spleeter
* pip install youtube_dl
* pip install youtubesearchpython

its obviously quite hacked together from spleeter and my basic knowledge of Tkinter python.
